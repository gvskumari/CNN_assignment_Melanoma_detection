## General Information
- This project is related to CNN based model.
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis
- In this assignment, we are trying to detect melanoma

## Technologies Used
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, tensorflow.keras
- Google Colab notebook is used for python programming
